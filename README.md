## 🎯 Technical Case Study & Features

This project was developed as a complete solution covering the full loan lifecycle (origination, servicing, collection, and reporting).

### I. Full-Stack Architecture
* **Frameworks:** Developed the full-stack application using the **Laravel Framework**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Alpine.js**.
* **Data Flow:** The application operates via a comprehensive **RESTful API**, which facilitates data retrieval for loan status, customer details, and financial reports from the MySQL database.

### II. Advanced Data Reporting
* **Data Visualization:** Implemented data-driven reports dashboard that utilizes **Chart.js** to display dynamic statistics. This capability provides valuable insights into the loan portfolio's performance.
* **PDF Generation:** Engineered a crucial backend feature to dynamically generate and allow the download of **PDF financial statements** for monthly financial reports.
* **Loan Servicing:** The system automates tasks such as tracking loan payments, interest calculations, and maintaining amortization schedules.

### III. UX and Maintainability
* **Modular Design:** The front-end uses reusable **Blade components** for layouts, statistic cards, and panels, ensuring a modular and maintainable structure.
* **User Experience (UX):** Implemented key features such as a **persistent dark mode toggle** (using Alpine.js and localStorage) and asynchronous user notifications.

## 🔒 Security & Confidentiality

As this system handles sensitive financial data, the following standards were applied:
1.  **API Security:** All data transmission occurs over secure channels.
2.  **Access Control:** Authentication and authorization are handled server-side to protect sensitive data.
3.  **Data Storage:** Database credentials and core business logic remain strictly on the private server and are never committed to this public repository.
